I recently opened the *Issue* tab. Since I may busy for some reasons that cannot catch up with the latest news about San Francisco fonts, you can tell me about it using the tab, along with proof (or link to the news about the new font). I'll try to update as soon as possible. You can also use the tab to report issues about the website.

For *Pull requests* tab, if you found some errors in the website code (located in [website_resources](/website_resources)) - or you want to improve the website, you can make a pull request (PR). Please note that do not change the base theme ("Medigo" theme) or the font of the website.
